# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project is a deep learning model that detects brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model is built using the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend and trained on a dataset of labeled brain MRI images.


# Features
Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify MRI scans as either tumor or non-tumor Provides an accuracy score and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance Includes a script to preprocess MRI images and generate labeled training data Supports the use of transfer learning for improved model accuracy

# Usage
To use the brain tumor detection system, run the BrainTumorDetection.py script with a path to an MRI scan as the input. The script will output the probability of the scan containing a tumor and a visualization of the regions of the scan that the model identified as potentially containing a tumor.
